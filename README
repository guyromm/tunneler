SDL Tunneler is a clone of legendary DOS-game called tunneler! The
original tunneler was made by Geoffrey Silverton in 1991. In the game
two players using the same keyboard and the same screen each control an
underground tank. Goal is to find and destroy the opponent's tank. Since
only small part of the map is displayed on the split screen, you might
actually have some searching to do.

The SDL tunneler was made by Taneli Kalvas in 2003. I ported this game
because I think it is great fun and wanted a native linux version of this
game (The real reason is that I was bored and I wanted to test the SDL
library).


Tech
----

Original tunneler was designed to run on a 6 MHz PC with some kind of color
graphics adapter. The original game ran in 80x50 text mode using 16 colors
of the text mode and a specially designed font to achieve a 160x100
"graphics" mode.

The new SDL tunneler uses stardard graphics modes provided by SDL library.
The game only uses ANSI C and SDL functions so you should be able to compile
the game for any platform supported by SDL. I have compiled tunneler for
linux and win32.


Installation and configuring
----------------------------

The compilation uses GNU autotools. To configure for compilation, do
'./configure' with the necessary parameters to indicate installation
location. Then do 'make' to compile and 'make install' to install the
binary. The game should compile in windows if the configure script
defines a 'WIN32=1' tag, if not then I hope someone can fix the
configure script to do so. I will not touch windows computers!

When you start the game for first time it will run in a window with 800x600
resolution. You can change the video mode in settings menu or you can use
command linux parameters -w, -h and --fullscreen. You can also change the
keyboard bindings in the settings menu. The game saves the parameters to
~/.tunnelerrc in linux and to tunneler.ini in windows.


Happy Tunneling!
